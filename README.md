# BloodShed 
## Whats BloodShed?  
is a Murder-based gamemode, with some realism and many new mechanics for the game.  
  
There are many mechanics in the mode, such as :

>  * A unique ragdoll system with shooting and medicine.  
>  * Improved medicine and blood effects.  
>  * Improved NPC system and their navigation.  
>  * The police and guilt system.  
>  * Advanced animations and killmoves.

**The main feature of the mode** is the advanced ragdoll and NPC systems. With the help of ragdoll you can climb on walls, hide inside tight spaces, force ragdoll someone, take a convenient position for shooting and much more. When you receive any type of damage, you lose control of the ragdoll and you may fall. The police and police NPCs can arrest you if you show aggression towards other players or the police.  
  
## Main Gamemodes  
  
BloodShed has many types of rounds and sub-modes  
1. Default Scenario :  
    Traitor is equipped with a knife, a cyanide canister, and an acid syringe, while the Gunman carries only a pistol.  
2. State of Emergency :
    Traitor is equipped with a pistol, grenade, IED, cyanide canister and acid syringe, but Gunman carries a heavy weapon.  
3. Infection :  
    Zombies manifest the map. You and others must survive until the evacuation timer runs out and reach the evacuation point. Die and you become one of them.  
4. Riot :  
    Players are split into two teams, Extremists and Security Forces. Security Forces must arrest or eliminate all Extremists, while Extremists must eliminate all Security Forces.
5. Team DeathMatch - DeathMatch :  
    TDM : Same as Riot but with guns  
    DM : You versus everyone, be the last one standing.  
6. Medieval :  
    Like TDM, this time you as you guessed its set in the Medieval times.
  
Counting the sub-modes with them totals to 13 special rounds.  
  
# BloodShed Rework
  
As for BSR, this is a modified version of BloodShed that was hosted for 6 months. With the permission of the original bloodshed dev Hari, I'm open sourcing this modified gamemode to you all but mind you even with some changes its buggy and almost like a piece of wood thats full of wacky nails and tape so im going to note the changes done and important stuff about some.  
  
## Changes/Notes  
  
+ Different PlayerModels.  
+ Players use their ingame nickname instead of a random one.  
+ Some bug fixes encountered with the OG Bloodshed.  
+ Different 3D voice chat.  
+ Guilt system disabled by previous devs, planned to modify it so it doesn't ban people after too many random kills or being inaccurate.  
+ Lowered NPC Spawns.  
+ Changed spawn chance for weapons.  
+ Different GamemodeChance RNG.  
+ Add more traitors depending on player count.  
+ Tweaked Ragdoll making it a bit easier.  
+ Changed ragdoll grab from toggle to hold.  
+ Added icons to let you know when you grab on something when ragdolled.  
  
+ Alot more changes lazy to note all  
  
There was spawnmenu and context menu access to certain roles using a custom sandbox gamemode with DeriveGamemode("sandbox"), it is disabled and not included.  
Alot was planned for this gamemode but due to real life issues on my end i haven't worked on it.
